# grafana-dashboard-sync

Goal of this project is to create tool that helps you to keep dashboards on
two separate grafana instances in sync between each others.

As a concrete use-case, even if you have split testing and production
environments into distinct networks, you probably want to have identical
dashboards for both environments.
